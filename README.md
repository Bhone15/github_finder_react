Github Finder,
This is just basic app for my learning reactjs.
To run locally this app, you need to have `nodejs` in ur machine and open the folder in terminal
and run `npm start` or `yarn start`.

The last things is go to https://github.com/settings/applications/new and
register for your own github api token
